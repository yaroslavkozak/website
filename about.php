            <p class="p-heading">Born and raised in Mumbai, India, I‚Äôm currently finishing my final year of Bachelor In Design program at York University/Sheridan College (also known as YSDN), in Toronto, Canada. I am a product design student, who loves crafting big ideas and is passionate about crafting meaningful experiences that influence positive change and can help make the world a better place. </p>
            <p class="separator">Driven by the idea that people can be motivated to do good, I aim to use creative problem-solving and human-centred design approach to create efficient and dynamic digital experiences that are accessible and inclusive for everyone to enjoy. At my core, I believes that in order to craft a seamless user experience and bring innovative ideas to life, it is important to understand the intersection of design, business, technology and the user.</p>
            <p class="separator">I am a self-motivated designer who is always looking for new challenges and opportunities that can help me continue to develop and grow as a designer. I‚Äôm actively seeking full-time new grad opportunities for 2019!

Thanks for viewing my portfolio! üôè</p>
